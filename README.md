## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I utilized the capability of CSS Flexbox in this coding challenge. This helps me layout all the elements properly.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I still need to develop and learn some CSS techniques in order for me to layout elements properly.

### Useful resources

- W3Schools - This helped me in layouting using Flexbox. I really recommend this website for beginners.
